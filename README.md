# OpenFoam: Rapid-solidification-phase-field-model

This is a implementation of a model for dendritic growth during the solidification of a pure metal. The model was developed in Comsol Multiphysics 5.6. If you want to have a quick look at what the model does, please have a look at the MP4 file. I provide a case file without a solution here on github to reduce file size (case file with solution is 14.5 GB)
