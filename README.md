1. The solver can be compiled from the solver directory provided. This creates a solver with the name "AlCu8". The name of the solver can be changed accordingly by changing the name in the 'files' in the 'Make' directory.
2. The required variables are initialized in createFields.H.
3. At each time step the value of the variables is calculated in the Variables.H.
4. After calculating variables Phase field variable (Phi, PhaseEq.H) and dimensionless supersaturation (u, CEq.H) are solved.
